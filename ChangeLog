gsk (1.0.35)
  * bug fix:  try the nameservers in the order listed in resolv.conf,
    instead of the reverse of that order.
  * Provide GSK_QSELECT()

gsk (1.0.34)
  * Provide GSK_QSORT(), a macro-based quicksort. (in gskqsortmacro.h)
  * Provide stack, deque and list macro-based implementations.
    (in gsklistmacros.h)
  * Add gsk_g_error_add_prefix().

gsk (1.0.33)
  * GskMemPoolFixed bug fix.
  * expose gsk/zlib/gskzlib.h for its helper functions.

gsk (1.0.32)
  * DNS bug fix.

gsk (1.0.30)
  * BUG: bogus assertions in gskdnsrrcache wrt to the is_deprecated flag.
  * Make DNS warning/debugging messages go to their own log-domain. (Gsk-Dns)

gsk (1.0.10)

  * BUILD BUG: sometimes -lreadline requires -ltermcap;
    in any event, test linkage.
  * MAJOR BUG: fixes in GskDnsClient list manipulation.
    The bug caused (under duress)
    "useless DNS message" warnings and segfaults.
  * add gsk_memory_source_new_vprintf()
  * automatically delete stale unix-domain sockets if a server tries
    to reuse the path.
  * Change gsk_name_resolve() to be deprecated,
    in favor of more correctly named gsk_name_resolver_task_new();
    casual, non-cancelling users may use gsk_name_resolver_lookup().
  * minor SSL issues
  * Add gsk-netcat program, for debugging and as useful example code.

gsk (1.0.9)
  * BUG: gskhttpserver was creating 0-length chunks which looked
    like EOF chunks.
  * BUG: gskmemory was shutting down while returning nonzero.
    i think we decided that that wasn't allowed.
  * add a line-based ring-buffer: GskLogRingBuffer.
  * add generic logging traps (gsk_log_trap_generic)
  * add ring-buffer logging traps (gsk_log_trap_ring_buffer)
  * API change: change gsk_log_trap_domain_to_file() to take
    the set of log-levels trapped.
  * BUG: gskmimemultipart{decoder,encoder} both had serious bugs
  * BUG: zlibdeflator didn't properly "finish" its data.
    zlibinflator wasn't always giving shutdown notification, nor syncing.

gsk (1.0.8)
  * allow user to set the DNS cache size
  * build fixes
  * BUG: GskStreamExternal was busy-looping.

gsk (1.0.7)
  * include GskControlServer/GskControlClient
    which provide a simple to implement generic control
    interface.  We also provide the gsk-control-client
    program which can talk to such a server, in general.
    Therefore, must programs will only need to implement the
    server.  An example server has been added in src/programs.
  * include GskHttpContent, a content database for implementing
    normal HTTP servers, which usually want to provide different handlers
    for various portions of the path/user-agent/virtual-host space.
  * BUG: GskStreamExternal: re-fix bug that caused
    stdin and stdout to be nonblocking.
  * gskdaemonize provides --foreground and --background options,
    as well as restart-on-segv or assertion failure support.

gsk (1.0.6)
  * compiler bug fix
  * bug fixes to gsklog.
  * this version was botched.  do not use it.

gsk (1.0.5)
  * API change:  GskPacket now has two addresses: a source and a destination
    instead of a single multi-use address.
  * change GskNetworkInterfaceSet::num_interfaces to an unsigned.
  * gsklog.h:  gmessage-based logging to files, using many domains. (daveb)
  * SHA-256 support in gskhash. (daveb)
  * GskStreamListenerSocket has a parameter to remove the entry
    from the file-system when done.

gsk (1.0.4)
  * memory leak in gskhttpclient and gskhttpserver finalize routines

gsk (1.0.1)
  * gsk_socket_address_localhost() becomes a macro,
    and more properly named gsk_socket_address_loopback()
    is added.  gsk_ipv4_ip_address_{any,loopback} globals
    are added, basically fixed as 0.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.1. (mrad)
  * Force absolute URLs to have a slash (/) after the host. (daveb)
  * Partial shutdown problem in HTTP client, noticed by Ted Witkamp. (daveb)
  * HTTP Download include query string (twitkamp)
  * shutdown-in-shutdown loop noticed by mrad. (daveb)
  * gsk_url_encode and gsk_url_encode_http weren't escaping some
    whitespace and other "non-unreserved" characters. (mrad)
  * various solaris fixes reported by Jeremy Leader (at Overture).
  * add gsk_timegm() which does the opposite of gmtime() portably. (daveb)
  * better handling of POLLHUP and POLLERR in GskMainLoop{Poll,Epoll}.
    Now the POLLHUP flag is propagated to G_IO_IN and POLLERR
    is propagated to G_IO_IN|G_IO_OUT.  This is roughly what
    BSD and select(2) do, so it seems right for linux/poll,epoll as well.
  * gsk_tree_remove wasn't removing newly inserted keys when a node
    with the same key was already being visited. (mrad)
  * Allow hooks to be safely untrapped/retrapped during notification. (mrad)
  * Allow hooks to defer shutdown notification when the hook is initialized
    with gsk_hook_mark_can_defer_shutdown, and the class's shutdown method
    returns false. (mrad)

gsk (1.0.0)

  * Completely rewritten to use 'streams' and 'hooks' instead 
    of 'actors'.
